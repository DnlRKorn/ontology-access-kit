    description: A collection of mapping rules

      rules:
        description: all rules
        range: MappingRule
        multivalued: true
        inlined: true

  MappingRule:
    description: An individual mapping rule, if preconditions match the postconditions are applied
    attributes:
      symmetric:
        ifabsent: True
        description: if true then subject and object can be switched and predicate inverted
      preconditions:
        range: Precondition
        multivalued: true
        slot_uri: sh:condition
        description: all of the criteria that must be true before a rule is fired
      postconditions:
        range: Precondition
        multivalued: true
        description: conditions that apply if preconditions match

    description: A pattern to be matched against an individual SSSOM mapping

        comments:
          - if the rule is invertible, then the predicate is inverted, e.g. skos broad becomes narrow
      weight:
        description: Weighting of the rule, positive increases the confidence, negative decreases
        range: float
